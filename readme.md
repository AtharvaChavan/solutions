What will hopefully be a collection of solutions in a bunch of languages for
problems from project euler, leetcode etc. Mostly an exercise in side-by-side
comparison of languages, to increase my understanding of those I don't use
day to day.

Eventual target languages:

1. x86 assembly
1. c
1. c#
1. c++
1. Clojure
1. Elixer
1. Go
1. Haskell
1. J
1. Java
1. JavaScript
1. Lua
1. Octave
1. OCaml
1. POSIX shell
1. Prolog
1. Python
1. Rust
1. Scheme

Current focus languages:

1. Haskell
1. OCaml
1. Clojure
